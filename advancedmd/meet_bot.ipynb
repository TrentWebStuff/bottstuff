      "SUMMARY: The purpose of the meeting was to discuss decisions and plans regarding the use of shell frameworks and card frameworks for the PM and EHR product portfolios. The main decisions to be made were whether to invest in one or a combination of frameworks, which frameworks to use as a base for investment, and how to implement the chosen frameworks. The need for these decisions arose from the need to upgrade the PM shell and the desire to share cards between frameworks. The discussion also touched on the importance of considering role-based views versus portfolio-based views when making these decisions. The level of sharing required for a roles-based view was emphasized, with different levels of abstraction and functionality discussed. It was agreed that different roles require different perspectives, and this should be considered in the design and configuration. The goal is to go deeper in terms of sharing components and avoid rebuilding them. The confusion between card frameworks and app shells was addressed, and the need for clarity in decision-making was emphasized. The investment is currently focused on the card framework, with plans to integrate it with the app shell later. It was acknowledged that this project will require multiple phases and strategic decisions. The idea of creating an SDK mechanism for third-party use was also mentioned as a valuable opportunity. The speaker discussed the benefits of providing an SDK to external organizations and onboarding new engineering teams quickly. They emphasized the difficulty of finding full stack engineers and highlighted the value of having a standardized framework for building and populating cards. The speaker mentioned that this framework would benefit Tim, Trent, and others when discussing the need for new shared cards. The meeting concluded with the need to make the right first choice in terms of how much sharing is required for a roles-based view.\u001b[0m\n",
